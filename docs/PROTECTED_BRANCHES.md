## Overview

**Problem:** GitHub and other platforms let you protect branches (like `main`) to require pull requests for all changes. This prevents beads from auto-committing issue updates directly to `main`.

**Solution:** Beads can commit to a separate branch (like `beads-metadata`) using git worktrees, while keeping your main working directory untouched. Periodically merge the metadata branch back to `main` via a pull request.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with any git platform's branch protection
- ✅ Main branch stays protected
- ✅ No disruption to your primary working directory
- ✅ Backward compatible (opt-in via config)
- ✅ Minimal disk overhead (uses sparse checkout)
- ✅ Platform-agnostic solution

## Quick Start

**1. Initialize beads with a separate sync branch:**

```bash
cd your-project
bd init --branch beads-metadata
```

This creates a `.beads/` directory and configures beads to commit to `beads-metadata` instead of `main`.

**2. Start the daemon with auto-commit:**

```bash
bd daemon start --auto-commit
```

The daemon will automatically commit issue changes to the `beads-metadata` branch.

**3. When ready, merge to main:**

```bash
# Check what's changed
bd sync --status

# Merge to main (creates a pull request or direct merge)
bd sync --merge
```

That's it! The complete workflow is described below.

## How It Works

### Git Worktrees

Beads uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to maintain a lightweight checkout of your sync branch. Think of it as a mini git clone that shares the same repository history.

**Directory structure:**

```
your-project/
├── .git/                    # Main git directory
│   └── beads-worktrees/
│       └── beads-metadata/  # Worktree (only .beads/ checked out)
│           └── .beads/
│               └── beads.jsonl
├── .beads/                  # Your main copy
│   ├── beads.db
│   └── beads.jsonl
└── src/                     # Your code (untouched)
```

**Key points:**
- The worktree is in `.git/beads-worktrees/` (hidden from your workspace)
- Only `.beads/` is checked out in the worktree (sparse checkout)
- Changes to issues are committed in the worktree
- Your main working directory is never affected
- Disk overhead is minimal (~few MB for the worktree)

### Automatic Sync

When you update an issue:

1. Issue is updated in `.beads/beads.db` (SQLite database)
2. Daemon exports to `.beads/beads.jsonl` (JSONL file)
3. JSONL is copied to worktree (`.git/beads-worktrees/beads-metadata/.beads/`)
4. Daemon commits the change in the worktree to `beads-metadata` branch
5. Main branch stays untouched (no commits on `main`)

## Setup

### Option 1: Initialize New Project

```bash
cd your-project
bd init --branch beads-metadata
```

This will:
- Create `.beads/` directory with database
- Set `sync.branch` config to `beads-metadata`
- Import any existing issues from git (if present)
- Prompt to install git hooks (recommended: say yes)

### Option 2: Migrate Existing Project

If you already have beads set up and want to switch to a separate branch:

```bash
# Set the sync branch
bd config set sync.branch beads-metadata

# Start the daemon (it will create the worktree automatically)
bd daemon start --auto-commit
```

### Daemon Configuration

For automatic commits to the sync branch:

```bash
# Start daemon with auto-commit
bd daemon start --auto-commit

# Or with auto-commit and auto-push
bd daemon start --auto-commit --auto-push
```

**Daemon modes:**
- `--auto-commit`: Commits to sync branch after each change
- `--auto-push`: Also pushes to remote after each commit
- Default interval: 5 seconds (check for changes every 5s)

**Recommended:** Use `--auto-commit` but not `--auto-push` if you want to review changes before pushing. Use `--auto-push` if you want fully hands-free sync.

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the sync branch via environment variable:

```bash
export BEADS_SYNC_BRANCH=beads-metadata
bd daemon start --auto-commit
```

This is useful for CI/CD or temporary overrides.

## Daily Workflow

### For AI Agents

AI agents work exactly the same way as before:

```bash
# Create issues
bd create "Implement user authentication" -t feature -p 1

# Update issues
bd update bd-a1b2 --status in_progress

# Close issues
bd close bd-a1b2 "Completed authentication"
```

All changes are automatically committed to the `beads-metadata` branch by the daemon. No changes are needed to agent workflows!

### For Humans

**Check status:**

```bash
# See what's changed on the sync branch
bd sync --status
```

This shows the diff between `beads-metadata` and `main` (or your current branch).

**Manual commit (if not using daemon):**

```bash
bd sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL and commit to sync branch
```

**Pull changes from remote:**

```bash
# Pull updates from other collaborators
bd sync --no-push
```

This pulls changes from the remote sync branch and imports them to your local database.

## Merging Changes

### Option 1: Via Pull Request (Recommended)

For protected branches with required reviews:

```bash
# 1. Push your sync branch
git push origin beads-metadata

# 2. Create PR on GitHub/GitLab/etc.
#    - Base: main
#    - Compare: beads-metadata

# 3. After PR is merged, update your local main
git checkout main
git pull
bd import  # Import the merged changes
```

### Option 2: Direct Merge (If Allowed)

If you have push access to `main`:

```bash
# Check what will be merged
bd sync --merge --dry-run

# Merge sync branch to main
bd sync --merge

# This will:
# - Switch to main branch
# - Merge beads-metadata with --no-ff (creates merge commit)
# - Push to remote
# - Import merged changes to database
```

**Safety checks:**
- ✅ Verifies you're not on the sync branch
- ✅ Checks for uncommitted changes in working tree
- ✅ Detects merge conflicts and provides resolution steps
- ✅ Uses `--no-ff` for clear history

### Merge Conflicts

If you encounter conflicts during merge:

```bash
# bd sync --merge will detect conflicts and show:
Error: Merge conflicts detected
Conflicting files:
  .beads/beads.jsonl

To resolve:
1. Fix conflicts in .beads/beads.jsonl
2. git add .beads/beads.jsonl
3. git commit
4. bd import  # Reimport to sync database
```

**Resolving JSONL conflicts:**

JSONL files are append-only and line-based, so conflicts are rare. When they occur:

1. Open `.beads/beads.jsonl` and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. Both versions are usually valid - keep both lines
3. Remove the conflict markers
4. Save and commit

Example conflict resolution:

```jsonl
<<<<<<< HEAD
{"id":"bd-a1b2","title":"Feature A","status":"closed","updated_at":"2025-11-02T10:00:00Z"}
=======
{"id":"bd-a1b2","title":"Feature A","status":"in_progress","updated_at":"2025-11-02T09:00:00Z"}
>>>>>>> beads-metadata
```

**Resolution:** Keep the line with the newer `updated_at`:

```jsonl
{"id":"bd-a1b2","title":"Feature A","status":"closed","updated_at":"2025-11-02T10:00:00Z"}
```

Then:

```bash
git add .beads/beads.jsonl
git commit -m "Resolve beads.jsonl merge conflict"
bd import  # Import to database (will use latest timestamp)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"

This happens if you created the sync branch independently. Merge with `--allow-unrelated-histories`:

```bash
git merge beads-metadata --allow-unrelated-histories --no-ff
```

Or use `bd sync --merge` which handles this automatically.

### "worktree already exists"

If the worktree is corrupted or in a bad state:

```bash
# Remove the worktree
rm -rf .git/beads-worktrees/beads-metadata

# Prune stale worktree entries
git worktree prune

# Restart daemon (it will recreate the worktree)
bd daemon restart
```

### "branch 'beads-metadata' not found"

The sync branch doesn't exist yet. The daemon will create it on the first commit. If you want to create it manually:

```bash
git checkout -b beads-metadata
git checkout main  # Switch back
```

Or just let the daemon create it automatically.

### "Cannot push to protected branch"

If the sync branch itself is protected:

1. **Option 1:** Unprotect the sync branch (it's metadata, doesn't need protection)
2. **Option 2:** Use `--auto-commit` without `--auto-push`, and push manually when ready
3. **Option 3:** Use a different branch name that's not protected

### Daemon won't start

Check daemon status and logs:

```bash
# Check status
bd daemon status

# View logs
tail -f ~/.beads/daemon.log

# Restart daemon
bd daemon restart
```

Common issues:
- Port already in use: Another daemon is running
- Permission denied: Check `.beads/` directory permissions
- Git errors: Ensure git is installed and repository is initialized

### Changes not syncing between clones

Ensure all clones are configured the same way:

```bash
# On each clone, verify:
bd config get sync.branch  # Should be the same (e.g., beads-metadata)

# Pull latest changes
bd sync --no-push

# Check daemon is running
bd daemon status
```

## FAQ

### Do I need to configure anything on GitHub/GitLab?

No! This is a pure git solution that works on any platform. Just protect your `main` branch as usual.

### Can I use a different branch name?

Yes! Use any branch name you want:

```bash
bd init --branch my-custom-branch
# or
bd config set sync.branch my-custom-branch
```

### Can I change the branch name later?

Yes:

```bash
bd config set sync.branch new-branch-name
bd daemon restart
```

The old worktree will remain (no harm), and a new worktree will be created for the new branch.

### What if I want to go back to committing to main?

Unset the sync branch config:

```bash
bd config set sync.branch ""
bd daemon restart
```

Beads will go back to committing directly to your current branch.

### Does this work with multiple collaborators?

Yes! Each collaborator configures their own sync branch:

```bash
# All collaborators use the same branch
bd config set sync.branch beads-metadata
```

Everyone's changes sync via the `beads-metadata` branch. Periodically merge to `main` via PR.

### How often should I merge to main?

This depends on your workflow:

- **Daily:** If you want issue history in `main` frequently
- **Per sprint:** If you batch metadata updates
- **As needed:** Only when you need others to see issue updates

There's no "right" answer - choose what fits your team.

### Can I review changes before merging?

Yes! Use `bd sync --status` to see what's changed:

```bash
bd sync --status
# Shows diff between beads-metadata and main
```

Or create a pull request and review on GitHub/GitLab.

### What about disk space?

Worktrees are very lightweight:
- Sparse checkout means only `.beads/` is checked out
- Typically < 1 MB for the worktree
- Shared git history (no duplication)

### Can I delete the worktree?

Yes, but the daemon will recreate it. If you want to clean up permanently:

```bash
# Stop daemon
bd daemon stop

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove .git/beads-worktrees/beads-metadata

# Unset sync branch
bd config set sync.branch ""
```

### Does this work with `bd sync`?

Yes! `bd sync` works normally and includes special commands for the merge workflow:

- `bd sync --status` - Show diff between branches
- `bd sync --merge` - Merge sync branch to main
- `bd sync --merge --dry-run` - Preview merge

### Can AI agents merge automatically?

Not recommended! Merging to `main` is a deliberate action that should be human-reviewed, especially with protected branches. Agents should create issues and update them; humans should merge to `main`.

However, if you want fully automated sync:

```bash
# WARNING: This bypasses branch protection!
bd daemon start --auto-commit --auto-push
bd sync --merge  # Run periodically (e.g., via cron)
```

### What if I forget to merge for a long time?

No problem! The sync branch accumulates all changes. When you eventually merge:

```bash
bd sync --merge
```

All accumulated changes will be merged at once. Git history will show the full timeline.

### Can I use this with GitHub Actions or CI/CD?

Yes! Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Sync Beads Metadata

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history

      - name: Install bd
        run: |
          curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

      - name: Pull changes
        run: |
          git fetch origin beads-metadata
          bd sync --no-push

      - name: Merge to main (if changes)
        run: |
          if bd sync --status | grep -q 'ahead'; then
            bd sync --merge
            git push origin main
          fi
```

**Note:** Make sure the GitHub Action has write permissions to push to `main`.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### GitHub

Protected branch settings:
1. Go to Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Check "Require pull request before merging"
4. Save

Create sync branch PR:
```bash
git push origin beads-metadata
gh pr create --base main --head beads-metadata --title "Update beads metadata"
```

### GitLab

Protected branch settings:
1. Settings → Repository → Protected Branches
2. Branch: `main`
3. Allowed to merge: Maintainers
4. Allowed to push: No one

Create sync branch MR:
```bash
git push origin beads-metadata
glab mr create --source-branch beads-metadata --target-branch main
```

### Bitbucket

Protected branch settings:
1. Repository settings → Branch permissions
2. Branch: `main`
3. Check "Prevent direct pushes"

Create sync branch PR:
```bash
git push origin beads-metadata
# Create PR via Bitbucket web UI
```

## Advanced Topics

### Multiple Sync Branches

You can use different sync branches for different purposes:

```bash
# Development branch
bd config set sync.branch beads-dev

# Production branch
bd config set sync.branch beads-prod
```

Switch between them as needed.

### Syncing with Upstream

If you're working on a fork:

```bash
# Add upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream beads-metadata to yours
git checkout beads-metadata
git merge upstream/beads-metadata
bd import  # Import merged changes
```

### Custom Worktree Location

By default, worktrees are in `.git/beads-worktrees/`. This is hidden and automatic. If you need a custom location, you'll need to manage worktrees manually (not recommended).

## Migration Guide

### From Direct Commits to Sync Branch

If you have an existing beads setup committing to `main`:

1. **Set sync branch:**
   ```bash
   bd config set sync.branch beads-metadata
   ```

2. **Restart daemon:**
   ```bash
   bd daemon restart
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   bd config get sync.branch  # Should show: beads-metadata
   ```

Future commits will go to `beads-metadata`. Historical commits on `main` are preserved.

### From Sync Branch to Direct Commits

If you want to stop using a sync branch:

1. **Unset sync branch:**
   ```bash
   bd config set sync.branch ""
   ```

2. **Restart daemon:**
   ```bash
   bd daemon restart
   ```

Future commits will go to your current branch (e.g., `main`).
