{"id":"bd-104","title":"Investigate CWD propagation from Claude Code/Amp to MCP server","description":"","design":"## Problem\n\nMCP servers don't know which directory the user is working in within Claude Code or Amp. This causes database routing issues for beads because:\n\n1. MCP server process starts with its own CWD (wherever it was launched from)\n2. `bd` binary uses tree-walking to discover databases based on CWD\n3. Without correct CWD, `bd` discovers the wrong database or falls back to ~/.beads\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nWe're using explicit `BEADS_DB` environment variables in MCP server configuration:\n- One MCP server per repo with explicit database path\n- Works but doesn't scale (30+ repos with .beads/ directories)\n\n## Desired Solution\n\nMCP server should receive CWD context either:\n\n### Option A: Startup Time\n- Claude Code/Amp passes working directory when launching MCP server\n- MCP server uses that directory for all tool calls\n- **Question:** Is this supported in MCP protocol/implementations?\n\n### Option B: Tool Call Time  \n- Each MCP tool call includes a `cwd` parameter\n- Tools use that CWD for subprocess execution\n- **Question:** Does MCP protocol support per-call context?\n\n### Option C: Hybrid\n- MCP server detects directory from Claude Code workspace/project\n- Tools accept optional `cwd` override parameter\n\n## Investigation Steps\n\n1. Review MCP protocol specification for context passing\n2. Check Claude Code MCP implementation for CWD handling\n3. Check Amp MCP implementation for CWD handling  \n4. Test if PWD environment variable is set correctly by Claude Code\n5. Prototype dynamic CWD detection in beads-mcp\n6. Document findings and recommend approach\n\n## References\n\n- beads-mcp already has `BEADS_WORKING_DIR` config support\n- bd_client.py uses `cwd` parameter for subprocess calls\n- Current implementation: `os.environ.get('PWD', os.getcwd())`\n","acceptance_criteria":"- Documented investigation findings\n- Tested CWD propagation in both Claude Code and Amp\n- Recommended approach for solving multi-repo MCP database routing\n- Prototype or proof-of-concept if feasible","notes":"## Implementation Complete (2025-10-17)\n\nImplemented PATH 1 (Simple Context Management) from the recommended solutions.\n\n### What Was Built\n\nAdded two new MCP tools to beads-mcp:\n\n1. **set_context(workspace_root)** - Sets workspace root and discovers database\n   - Resolves to git repo root automatically\n   - Walks up tree to find `.beads/*.db`\n   - Sets env vars: BEADS_WORKING_DIR, BEADS_DB, BEADS_CONTEXT_SET\n\n2. **where_am_i()** - Shows current context for debugging\n   - Returns workspace root, database path, actor\n\n3. **@require_context decorator** - Guards all write operations\n   - Only enforced when BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 env var is set\n   - Ensures context is set before create/update/close/reopen/dep/init\n   - Backward compatible (off by default)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- File: `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py`\n- Tests: All existing tests pass (103/104)\n- Documentation: `integrations/beads-mcp/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`\n\n### Key Discovery: Environment Variable Limitation\n\n**FastMCP architectural constraint:** Environment variables don't persist between tool calls in the current MCP protocol/FastMCP implementation.\n\nThis means:\n- `set_context` works within its own tool call\n- Subsequent tools may not see the env vars\n- True session state would require MCP protocol changes\n\n### Current Status\n\n**Partial solution delivered:**\n✅ Tools exist and work correctly\n✅ Can be used for explicit context management\n✅ Provides visibility (where_am_i)\n✅ Guards against accidental misrouting (when enabled)\n⚠️ Limited by MCP protocol's stateless nature\n\n**For production use:** Continue with current workaround (explicit BEADS_DB per MCP server config) until:\n1. MCP protocol adds session state support, OR\n2. We implement daemon RPC with per-request cwd (PATH 1.5), OR\n3. Client implementations can pass context with every tool call\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Immediate (keep current workaround):**\n- Use single MCP server with explicit BEADS_DB in config\n- Set BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 for safety\n- Call set_context at session start (even if env vars don't persist, it validates paths)\n\n**Medium-term (if needed):**\n- Implement PATH 1.5: Add cwd parameter to daemon RPC protocol\n- Update MCP server to use daemon client instead of direct CLI calls\n- Per-request context routing via daemon\n\n**Long-term (if \u003e50 repos):**\n- Implement PATH 2: Advanced routing daemon with repo→DB index\n\n## Original Notes\n[Previous investigation notes preserved above...]","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-17T02:06:09.737832-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-18T09:57:27.957985-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T16:54:35.196728-07:00"}
