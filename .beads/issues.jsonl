{"id":"bd-70","title":"Increase test coverage for auto-flush and auto-import features","description":"Critical features have 0% test coverage despite being core workflow functionality.\n\n**Uncovered areas (0% coverage):**\n\nAuto-flush/Auto-import (dirty tracking):\n- MarkIssueDirty / MarkIssuesDirty\n- GetDirtyIssues / GetDirtyIssueCount\n- ClearDirtyIssues / ClearDirtyIssuesByID\n- Auto-flush debouncing logic\n- Auto-import hash comparison\n\nDatabase/file discovery:\n- FindDatabasePath (finds .beads/*.db in directory tree)\n- FindJSONLPath (finds issues.jsonl)\n- findDatabaseInTree helper\n\nLabel operations:\n- AddLabel / RemoveLabel\n- GetLabels / GetIssuesByLabel\n\nEvents/Comments:\n- AddComment\n- GetEvents\n- GetStatistics\n\nMetadata storage:\n- SetMetadata / GetMetadata (used for import hash tracking)\n\nCLI output formatting:\n- outputJSON\n- printCollisionReport / printRemappingReport\n- createIssuesFromMarkdown\n\n**Priority areas:**\n1. Auto-flush/import (highest risk - core workflow)\n2. Database discovery (second - affects all operations)\n3. Labels/events (lower priority - less commonly used)\n\n**Test approach:**\n- Add unit tests for dirty tracking in sqlite package\n- Add integration tests for auto-flush timing and debouncing\n- Add tests for import hash detection and idempotency\n- Add tests for database discovery edge cases (permissions, nested dirs)\n\n**Target:** Get overall coverage from 60% → 75%, focus on cmd/bd (currently 24.1%)\n\n**Note:** These features work well in practice (dogfooding proves it) but edge cases (disk full, permissions, concurrent access, race conditions) are untested.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-14T14:14:13.483214-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-14T14:14:13.483214-07:00"}

Build excellent tooling to detect collisions during import, auto-renumber issues with fewer dependencies, update all references in descriptions and dependency links, and provide clear user feedback. Goal: keep beautiful brevity of numeric IDs (bd-302) while handling distributed creation gracefully.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-14T02:51:52.197433-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-14T14:16:10.559862-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-14T14:16:10.559862-07:00"}
