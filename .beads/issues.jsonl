{"id":"bd-45","title":"Make merge command idempotent for safe retry after partial failures","description":"The merge command currently performs 3 operations without an outer transaction:\n1. Migrate dependencies from source → target\n2. Update text references across all issues\n3. Close source issues\n\nIf merge fails mid-operation (network issue, daemon crash, etc.), a retry will fail or produce incorrect results because some operations already succeeded.\n\n**Goal:** Make merge idempotent so retrying after partial failure is safe and completes the remaining work.\n\n**Idempotency checks needed:**\n- Skip dependency migration if target already has the dependency\n- Skip text reference updates if already updated\n- Skip closing source issues if already closed\n- Report which operations were skipped vs performed\n\n**Example output:**\n```\n✓ Merged 2 issue(s) into bd-78\n  - Dependencies: 3 migrated, 2 already existed\n  - Text references: 5 updated, 0 already correct\n  - Source issues: 1 closed, 1 already closed\n```\n\n**Related:** bd-23 originally requested transaction support, but idempotency is a better solution for this use case since individual operations are already atomic.","design":"Current merge code already has some idempotency:\n- Dependency migration checks `alreadyExists` before adding (line ~145-151 in merge.go)\n- Text reference updates are naturally idempotent (replacing bd-X with bd-Y twice has same result)\n\nMissing idempotency:\n- CloseIssue fails if source already closed\n- Error messages don't distinguish \"already done\" from \"real failure\"\n\nImplementation:\n1.
