The actual problem was:\n\n**Import/Export hanging when daemon is running** due to SQLite lock contention:\n\n1. When daemon is connected, `PersistentPreRun` in main.go returns early without initializing the `store` variable\n2. Import/Export commands then tried to open the database directly with `sqlite.New(dbPath)` \n3. This blocked waiting for the database lock that the daemon already holds → **HANGS INDEFINITELY**\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nModified both import.go and export.go to:\n1. Detect when `daemonClient` is connected\n2. Explicitly close the daemon connection before opening direct SQLite access\n3. Added debug logging to help diagnose similar issues\n\nThis ensures import/export commands always run in direct mode, avoiding lock contention.\n\n## File Path Handling\n\nThe file path confusion (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl) was a red herring. The code uses `filepath.Glob(\"*.jsonl\")` which correctly finds ANY `.jsonl` file in `.beads/` directory, so both filenames work.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:00:55.78797-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","source_repo":"."}

However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1. Second daemon start fails with \"daemon already running\" error\n✅ 2. Killing daemon releases lock, new daemon can start  \n✅ 3.

Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","design":"## Architecture: Agent-Supervised Migrations (Inversion of Control)\n\n**Key principle:** Beads provides observability and validation primitives.

Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc,-1","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:23:57.978339-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.182513-07:00","source_repo":"."}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.952447-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:36:13.971527-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:27:29.41629-08:00","source_repo":"."}

The daemon silently fails for certain commands while appearing healthy.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Make local changes to issues (creates uncommitted .beads/beads.jsonl)\n2. Remote has updates (JSONL newer, triggers auto-import)\n3. Daemon tries to pull but fails: 'cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes'\n4. Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","design":"Options to fix:\n\n1. Skip auto-import when git is dirty (safest, simplest)\n   - Check git status before pull\n   - Log warning and continue without import\n   - User must manually import after cleaning git state\n\n2. Async import with timeout (better UX)\n   - Run auto-import in background goroutine\n   - Don't block RPC command execution\n   - Timeout after 5s, log error if stuck\n   - Use sync.Once or similar to prevent concurrent imports\n\n3. Transactional import with rollback\n   - Wrap import in database transaction\n   - Rollback if git operations fail\n   - Ensure storage is never left in bad state\n\nRecommended: Combine #1 and #2\n- Check git status first, skip if dirty\n- If clean, do async import with timeout\n- Add metrics to track import success/failure rates","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181425-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949061-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949064-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181857-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

Repeat\n\nThis has been happening for **weeks** and is extremely frustrating.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe recommended conflict resolution (`git checkout --theirs`) throws away local database state (comments, dependencies, closed issues). The daemon then immediately re-exports, creating a dirty state.\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nManual `bd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 git add \u0026\u0026 git commit \u0026\u0026 git push` after every failed sync.\n\n## Example Session\n\n```bash\n$ bd sync\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in .beads/beads.jsonl\n\n$ git checkout --theirs .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 bd import \u0026\u0026 git add \u0026\u0026 git commit \u0026\u0026 git push\n# Pushed successfully\n\n$ git status\nmodified: .beads/beads.jsonl  # DIRTY AGAIN!\n```\n\n## Lost Data in Recent Session\n\n- bd-ry1u closure (lost in merge)\n- Comments on bd-08fd, bd-23a8, bd-6049, bd-87a0 (lost)\n- Dependencies that existed only in local DB\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Use beads-merge tool** - Implement proper 3-way JSONL merge (bd-bzfy)\n2. **Smarter conflict resolution** - Detect when `--theirs` will lose data, warn user\n3. **Sync validation** - Check if JSONL == DB after merge, re-export if needed\n4. **Daemon awareness** - Pause auto-export during merge resolution\n5. **Transaction log** - Replay local changes after merge instead of losing them\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- bd-bzfy (beads-merge integration)\n- Possibly related to daemon auto-export behavior","notes":"## Solution Implemented\n\nFixed the recurring dirty state after merge conflicts by adding **sync validation** before re-exporting.\n\n### Root Cause\nLines 217-237 in `sync.go` unconditionally re-exported DB to JSONL after every import, even when they were already in sync. This created an infinite loop:\n1. User runs `bd sync` which pulls and imports remote JSONL\n2. Sync unconditionally re-exports DB (which has local changes)\n3. JSONL becomes dirty immediately\n4. Repeat\n\n### Fix\nAdded `dbNeedsExport()` function in `integrity.go` that checks:\n- If JSONL exists\n- If DB modification time is newer than JSONL\n- If DB and JSONL issue counts match\n\nNow `bd sync` only re-exports if DB actually has changes that differ from JSONL.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `dbNeedsExport()` in `cmd/bd/integrity.go` (lines 228-271)\n- Updated `sync.go` lines 217-251 to check before re-exporting\n- Added comprehensive tests in `cmd/bd/sync_merge_test.go`\n\n### Testing\nAll tests pass including 4 new tests:\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_InSync` - Verifies no export when synced\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_DBNewer` - Detects DB modifications\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_CountMismatch` - Catches divergence\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_NoJSONL` - Handles missing JSONL\n\nThis prevents the weeks-long frustration of merge conflicts causing infinite dirty loops.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:52:14.776063-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:28.358028-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.179059-07:00","source_repo":"."}

This would catch silent failures where the export appears to succeed but doesn't actually write all issues.\n\nReal-world scenario from VC project:\n- Ran direct SQL DELETE to remove 240 issues  \n- Ran 'bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl'\n- No error shown, appeared to succeed\n- But JSONL file was not updated (still had old line count)\n- Later session found all 240 issues still in JSONL\n- Had to repeat the cleanup\n\nIf export had verified line count, it would have immediately shown:\n  Error: Export verification failed\n    Expected: 276 issues\n    JSONL file: 516 lines\n    Mismatch indicates export failed to write all issues\n\nThis is especially important because:\n1. JSONL is source of truth in git\n2. Silent export failures cause data inconsistency\n3. Users assume export succeeded if no error shown\n4. The verification is cheap (just count lines)\n\nImplementation:\n- After writing JSONL, count lines in file\n- Compare to len(exportedIDs)\n- If mismatch, remove temp file and return error\n- Show clear error message with both counts","design":"In cmd/bd/export.go, after atomic rename (line ~301):\n\n1. Count lines in final JSONL file:\n   - Read file and count newlines\n   - Or reuse countIssuesInJSONL() helper (already exists)\n\n2. Compare to len(exportedIDs)\n\n3. If mismatch:\n   - Log error with both counts\n   - Optionally: remove the bad JSONL file (or leave for debugging?)\n   - Return error (exit 1)\n\n4. Consider adding --skip-verify flag for edge cases\n\nEdge cases:\n- Partial line writes (corrupted file)\n- File system issues\n- Race conditions (another process modifying JSONL during export)\n\nThe countIssuesInJSONL() function already exists at line 20, can reuse it.","acceptance_criteria":"1. bd export verifies JSONL line count after write\n2. Clear error shown if mismatch detected\n3. Test case that simulates partial write failure\n4.
