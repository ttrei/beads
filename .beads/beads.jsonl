UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc,-1","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:23:57.978339-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.182513-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.952447-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T17:53:09.075064-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:52.260524-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.18193-07:00"}
