VC imports Beads (VC → Beads dependency) and wraps it with VC-specific storage methods. Both share the same database but maintain separate table namespaces.\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n1.

Maintenance Burden: Every Beads feature must be manually replicated\n\n**Concrete Example:**\nWhen Beads adds a new field (e.g., estimated_hours):\n- Current: 4-6 hours of manual work (update types, 6+ SQL queries, migration, testing)\n- With Library: 5 minutes (go get -u github.com/steveyegge/beads)\n\n**Phased Approach:**\n1.

{"id":"bd-115","title":"Implement exclusive lock protocol for daemon/external tool coexistence","description":"VC (VibeCoder) cannot coexist with bd daemon managing the same database. VC needs deterministic execution and directly manages JSONL sync, but daemon's auto-flush creates timing conflicts and nondeterministic behavior.\n\nCurrent workaround (vc-195): VC kills ALL bd daemon processes with pkill, which is too aggressive and prevents developers from using daemon for their own workflow.\n\nSolution: Implement lock file protocol (.beads/.exclusive-lock) that allows applications to claim exclusive management of a database. bd daemon respects these locks and skips locked databases.\n\nSee VC_DAEMON_EXCLUSION_PROTOCOL.md for full specification.","design":"Lock File Protocol:\n- File: .beads/.exclusive-lock (JSON format)\n- Contains: holder name, PID, hostname, timestamp, version\n- Created when external tool (VC) starts\n- Removed on clean shutdown\n- Stale lock detection: if PID doesn't exist, lock is removed\n\nbd daemon behavior:\n1.

This causes:\n1. Import updates all 83 issues' timestamps (e.g., 2025-10-23T11:01:13.xxx)\n2. Export writes JSONL with new timestamps\n3. Git shows JSONL as modified with 200+ line changes\n4.

User commits code changes → JSONL appears clean\n3. Daemon flush fires → JSONL modified after commit\n4. Result: dirty working tree showing JSONL changes\n\n**Root cause:**\n- Auto-flush uses 5-second debounce to batch changes\n- Git commits happen immediately\n- No coordination between flush schedule and git operations\n\n**Possible solutions:**\n\n1. **Immediate flush before git operations**\n   - Detect git commands (commit, status, push)\n   - Force immediate flush if pending\n   - Pros: Clean working tree guaranteed\n   - Cons: Requires hooking git, may be slow\n\n2. **Commit includes pending flushes**\n   - Add `bd sync` to commit workflow\n   - Wait for flush to complete before committing\n   - Pros: Simple, explicit\n   - Cons: Requires user discipline\n\n3. **Git hooks integration**\n   - pre-commit hook: `bd sync --wait`\n   - Ensures JSONL is up-to-date before commit\n   - Pros: Automatic, reliable\n   - Cons: Requires hook installation\n\n4. **Reduce debounce delay**\n   - Lower from 5s to 1s or 500ms\n   - Pros: Faster sync, less likely to race\n   - Cons: More frequent I/O, doesn't eliminate race\n\n5. **Lock-based coordination**\n   - Daemon holds lock while flush pending\n   - Git operations wait for lock\n   - Pros: Guarantees ordering\n   - Cons: Complex, may block operations\n\n**Recommended approach:**\nCombine #2 and #3:\n- Add `bd sync` command to explicitly flush\n- Provide git hooks in `examples/git-hooks/`\n- Document workflow in AGENTS.md\n- Keep 5s debounce for normal operations\n\n**Related:**\n- bd-38 (daemon version detection)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:16:29.502191-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-25T23:15:33.519467-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-24T22:17:18.871457-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-91","title":"Daemon storage cache doesn't detect external database modifications","description":"When bd commands bypass the daemon and directly modify the database (e.g., `bd import` with direct file access, or deleting/recreating bd.db), the daemon's cached storage connection becomes stale and serves outdated data.\n\n**Reproduction**:\n1. Start daemon: `bd daemon`\n2. Run bd stats → shows N issues\n3. Delete database: `rm .beads/bd.db`  \n4. Reinit and import: `bd init \u0026\u0026 bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl`\n5. Run bd stats → shows 0 issues (wrong!)\n6. Direct query: `sqlite3 .beads/bd.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues'` → shows correct count\n7. Restart daemon: `bd daemon --stop` then retry stats → now shows correct count\n\n**Root cause**: \n- server.go:1410-1414 retrieves cached storage without checking if DB file changed\n- Cache only evicts based on TTL (30min) or LRU, never on external modifications\n- Direct file operations bypass daemon, leaving cache stale\n\n**Impact**:\n- Users see incorrect/stale data after external DB operations\n- Confusing behavior with no clear indication cache is stale\n- Requires daemon restart to fix\n\n**Proposed fixes**:\n1. Check mtime on cache hit, invalidate if file changed\n2. Add cache eviction API (bd cache --clear)\n3. Use file locking to prevent external modifications while daemon running\n4. SQLite WAL mode change notifications","design":"**Better approach: Check DB file mtime on cache lookup**\n\nToo many commands bypass the daemon (import, init, renumber, compact, delete, dep tree, export, stale). Notifying from each would be error-prone and easy to forget when adding new commands.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. Add `dbMtime time.Time` field to `StorageCacheEntry`\n2. In `getStorageForRequest()` on cache hit:\n   - Stat the DB file to get current mtime\n   - If mtime changed since cached, evict entry and reopen\n   - Otherwise return cached connection\n3. Store mtime when initially caching\n\n**Code location:**\n- `internal/rpc/server.go:1410-1414` (cache hit path)\n- `internal/rpc/server.go:49-52` (StorageCacheEntry struct)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Simple, centralized check\n- Works for all commands that bypass daemon\n- Works for external tools modifying DB\n- No need to update every command\n- Minimal performance overhead (one stat() call on cache hit)\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- Small overhead on every cache hit (negligible - stat is fast)\n- mtime granularity may miss rapid changes (unlikely in practice)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-24T13:35:23.108829-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-25T23:15:33.506573-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-21T21:51:22.331957-07:00"}

For existing databases with stale counters:\n\n- Import doesn't resync the counter\n- Delete doesn't update counter  \n- Renumber doesn't fix counter\n- Counter remains stuck at old high value\n\nExample from today:\n- Had 49 issues after clean import\n- Counter stuck at 4106 from previous test pollution\n- Next issue would be bd-4107 instead of bd-12\n- Even after renumber, counter stayed at 4106\n\nRoot cause: Migration only syncs if table is empty (line 182 in sqlite.go). Once populated, never resyncs.\n\nFix needed: \n1. Sync counter after import operations (not just empty table)\n2. Add counter resync after renumber\n3.

All operations (import, delete, renumber) now properly sync counters.
