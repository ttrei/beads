All tests appear to pass when examined individually\n2. Likely causes:\n   - Race detector finding data races during test cleanup (`-race` flag)\n   - Panic/error occurring after main tests complete\n   - Test harness issue not reporting actual failure\n   - Possible regression from PR #203 (dependency_type changes)\n\n## Recent CI Runs\n- Run 19015040655 (latest): 3/4 failing\n- Multiple recent commits tried to fix Windows/lint issues\n- Agent on rrnewton/beads fork attempting fixes (2/4 passing there)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Run tests locally with `-race -v` to see full output\n2. Check for unreported test failures or panics\n3. Examine test cleanup/teardown code\n4. Review recent changes around close command tests\n5.

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.182217-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:47:28.317007-07:00"}

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.974702-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00"}

However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1.

If the JSONL file contains child issues whose parents were deleted, auto-import fails:\n\n```\nAuto-import failed: error creating issues: parent issue bd-1f4086c5 does not exist\n```\n\nThis blocks ALL imports, even though bd-1f4086c5 exists in git history (findable via commit log).\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nSchema validation is too strict:\n- Hierarchical ID validation requires parent to exist in database\n- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned child issues\n- Import fails atomically - one bad issue blocks everything\n\nResult: Database stuck at 296 issues, JSONL has more recent data including bd-a101, but can't sync.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nBeads should roll forward gracefully:\n1. Import should continue even if parent is missing\n2. Options for handling orphaned children:\n   - Skip orphaned issues with warning (log them)\n   - Import orphaned issues anyway (relax parent validation)\n   - Convert hierarchical ID to top-level (bd-abc.1 → bd-abc-1)\n   - Track missing parents and prompt user to restore or clean up\n\n## Root Cause\n\nSchema is trying too hard to be the boss. Valid use cases:\n- Deleting old issues for hygiene (totally OK)\n- Git history preserves deleted issues (forensics still work)\n- JSONL evolution across branches/clones may have different deletion states\n\n## Impact\n\n- Blocks database sync completely\n- Prevents multi-repo work (can't test with current database)\n- Makes bd-delete risky (can break future imports)\n\n## Design Question\n\nHow strict should parent validation be?\n- **Too strict** (current): Fails entire import on missing parent\n- **Too loose**: Allows orphaned children, breaks dependency tree integrity  \n- **Just right**: ???

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-dcd6f14b to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:52:05.462747-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00"}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6. Add `bd validate` command to detect divergence\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.959435-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.207148-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T21:57:03.06641-07:00"}

Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","design":"## Architecture: Agent-Supervised Migrations (Inversion of Control)\n\n**Key principle:** Beads provides observability and validation primitives.

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.19679-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T22:22:20.406934-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.952447-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T17:53:09.075064-07:00"}

The daemon silently fails for certain commands while appearing healthy.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Make local changes to issues (creates uncommitted .beads/beads.jsonl)\n2. Remote has updates (JSONL newer, triggers auto-import)\n3. Daemon tries to pull but fails: 'cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes'\n4. Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","design":"Options to fix:\n\n1. Skip auto-import when git is dirty (safest, simplest)\n   - Check git status before pull\n   - Log warning and continue without import\n   - User must manually import after cleaning git state\n\n2. Async import with timeout (better UX)\n   - Run auto-import in background goroutine\n   - Don't block RPC command execution\n   - Timeout after 5s, log error if stuck\n   - Use sync.Once or similar to prevent concurrent imports\n\n3. Transactional import with rollback\n   - Wrap import in database transaction\n   - Rollback if git operations fail\n   - Ensure storage is never left in bad state\n\nRecommended: Combine #1 and #2\n- Check git status first, skip if dirty\n- If clean, do async import with timeout\n- Add metrics to track import success/failure rates","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181425-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949061-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949064-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181857-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267736-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:52.260524-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.18193-07:00"}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:28.358028-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.179059-07:00"}

Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// buildHashMap creates a map of content hash → issue\nfunc buildHashMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// buildIDMap creates a map of ID → issue\nfunc buildIDMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ID] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// handleRename handles content match with different IDs\nfunc handleRename(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage, \n    existing *types.Issue, incoming *types.Issue) error {\n    \n    // Delete old ID\n    if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, existing.ID); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete old ID %s: %w\", existing.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Create with new ID\n    if err := s.CreateIssue(ctx, incoming, \"import-rename\"); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create renamed issue %s: %w\", \n            incoming.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Update references from old ID to new ID\n    idMapping := map[string]string{existing.ID: incoming.ID}\n    return updateReferences(ctx, s, idMapping)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add idempotency tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. Import same JSONL twice → second import reports all Unchanged\n2. Import, modify DB, import again → reports Updated\n3. Import with rename, import again → idempotent\n4. Import with collision resolution, import again → idempotent\n\n### 4. Update handleCollisions to use new flow\nCurrent handleCollisions in importer.go needs to be updated to:\n- Use content-first matching\n- Call new ResolveNWayCollisions\n- Apply results using ApplyCollisionResolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Import matches by content hash before checking IDs\n- Importing same JSONL multiple times is idempotent (reports Unchanged)\n- Rename detection works (same content, different ID)\n- ID conflicts resolved using global algorithm\n- Result.Unchanged correctly tracks idempotent imports\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes\n- All existing import tests still pass\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- buildHashMap correctly indexes by content hash\n- buildIDMap correctly indexes by ID\n- handleRename deletes old, creates new, updates references\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Import same data twice → idempotent\n- Import renamed issue → handled correctly\n- Import with collision → resolved globally\n- Final pull after 3-way collision → all clones converge\n\n### Property Tests\n- Idempotency: Import(x); Import(x) ≡ Import(x)\n- Commutativity: Import(a); Import(b) ≡ Import(b); Import(a) (for non-colliding issues)\n- Convergence: After N rounds of sync, all clones identical\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/importer/importer.go (major refactor of ImportIssues)\n- internal/importer/importer_test.go (new tests)\n- cmd/bd/import_bug_test.go (update for new behavior)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.3 (global resolution)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nMajor refactor of import logic. Recommend:\n1. Comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Feature flag to enable/disable\n3. Keep old import code path for rollback\n4. Test with all existing import tests\n5. Manual testing with real repositories\n\n## Success Metrics\nAfter this phase:\n- TestThreeCloneCollision should PASS\n- All clones converge after final pull\n- Import is demonstrably idempotent\n- No data loss in N-way scenarios","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:38:25.671302-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.229134-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:21:39.529971-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.616846-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.360026-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.383624-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.407157-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Collects ALL versions of same logical issue\n2. Sorts by content hash (deterministic)\n3. Assigns sequential IDs based on sorted order\n4. All clones converge to same assignments\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create ResolveNWayCollisions function\nFile: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions with:\n```go\n// ResolveNWayCollisions handles N-way collisions deterministically.\n// Groups all versions with same base ID, sorts by content hash,\n// assigns sequential IDs. Returns mapping of old ID → new ID.\nfunc ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    collisions []*CollisionDetail, incoming []*types.Issue) (map[string]string, error) {\n    \n    if len(collisions) == 0 {\n        return make(map[string]string), nil\n    }\n    \n    // Group by base ID pattern (e.g., test-1, test-2 → base \"test-1\")\n    groups := groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions)\n    \n    idMapping := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for baseID, versions := range groups {\n        // 1. Collect all unique versions by content hash\n        uniqueVersions := deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(versions)\n        \n        // 2. Sort by content hash (deterministic!)\n        sort.Slice(uniqueVersions, func(i, j int) bool {\n            return uniqueVersions[i].ContentHash \u003c uniqueVersions[j].ContentHash\n        })\n        \n        // 3.

Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// groupCollisionsByBaseID groups collisions by their logical base ID\nfunc groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions []*CollisionDetail) map[string][]*types.Issue {\n    groups := make(map[string][]*types.Issue)\n    for _, c := range collisions {\n        baseID := c.ID  // All share same ID (that's why they collide)\n        groups[baseID] = append(groups[baseID], c.ExistingIssue, c.IncomingIssue)\n    }\n    return groups\n}\n\n// deduplicateVersionsByContentHash keeps one issue per unique content hash\nfunc deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(issues []*types.Issue) []*types.Issue {\n    seen := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        if _, found := seen[issue.ContentHash]; !found {\n            seen[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n        }\n    }\n    result := make([]*types.Issue, 0, len(seen))\n    for _, issue := range seen {\n        result = append(result, issue)\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update handleCollisions in importer\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions call with:\n```go\n// OLD:\nif err := sqlite.ScoreCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult.Collisions, allExistingIssues); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to score collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// NEW:\nidMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n    collisionResult.Collisions, issues)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to resolve collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update RemapCollisions\nRemapCollisions currently uses collision.RemapIncoming field. Update to use idMapping directly:\n- Remove RemapIncoming logic\n- Use idMapping to determine what to remap\n- Simplify to just apply the computed mapping\n\n### 5. Add comprehensive tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. 3-way collision with different content → 3 sequential IDs\n2. 3-way collision with 2 identical content → 2 IDs (dedupe works)\n3. Sync order independence (A→B→C vs C→A→B produce same result)\n4. Content hash ordering is respected\n5. Works with 5+ clones\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ResolveNWayCollisions implemented and replaces ScoreCollisions\n- Groups all versions of same ID together\n- Deduplicates by content hash\n- Sorts by content hash deterministically\n- Assigns sequential IDs starting from base ID\n- Returns complete mapping (old ID → new ID)\n- All clones converge to same ID assignments\n- Works for arbitrary N-way collisions\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes (or gets much closer)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (new function, helpers)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (call new function)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (comprehensive tests)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- groupCollisionsByBaseID correctly groups\n- deduplicateVersionsByContentHash removes duplicates\n- Sorting by hash is stable and deterministic\n- Sequential ID assignment is correct\n\n### Integration Tests\n- 3-way collision resolves to 3 issues\n- Sync order doesn't affect final IDs\n- Content hash ordering determines winner\n\n### Property Tests\n- For any N clones with same content, all converge to same IDs\n- Idempotent: running resolution twice produces same result\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field) to be completed first\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection) for clean integration\n\n## Notes\nThis is the core algorithm that enables convergence.

In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T17:19:13.188769-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T17:19:13.188772-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-e6d71828","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.1","type":"related","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:44:44.14653-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

README.md\nAdd section explaining hash IDs:\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs\n\nBeads uses **hash-based IDs** for collision-free distributed issue tracking:\n\n- **Hash ID**: `bd-af78e9a2` (8-char SHA256 prefix, immutable, globally unique)\n- **Alias**: `#42` (sequential number, mutable, human-friendly)\n\n### Using IDs\n```bash\nbd show bd-af78e9a2   # Use hash ID\nbd show #42           # Use alias\nbd show 42            # Use alias (shorthand)\n```\n\n### Why Hash IDs?\n- **Collision-free**: Work offline without ID conflicts\n- **Distributed**: No coordination needed between clones\n- **Git-friendly**: Different IDs = different JSONL lines, fewer merge conflicts\n\n### Aliases\nAliases are workspace-local shortcuts for hash IDs. They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3. QUICKSTART.md (if exists)\nShow alias usage in examples:\n```bash\n# Create issue (gets hash ID + alias)\nbd create \"Fix authentication bug\" -p 1\n# → Created bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #1)\n\n# Reference by alias\nbd show #1\nbd update #1 --status in_progress\nbd close #1 --reason \"Fixed\"\n```\n\n### 4. ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5.

MCP Function Signatures (No Change)\nFunctions already use issue IDs as strings, so they work with hash IDs:\n\n```python\n# These already work!\nbeads_show(issue_id: str)           # Accepts bd-af78e9a2 or #42\nbeads_update(issue_id: str, ...)    # Accepts both formats\nbeads_close(issue_ids: List[str])   # Accepts both formats\n```\n\n### 2. Add Alias Resolution Helper\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n\n```python\ndef resolve_issue_id(issue_id: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Resolve alias to hash ID if needed.\"\"\"\n    # Hash ID: pass through\n    if issue_id.startswith('bd-') and len(issue_id) == 11:\n        return issue_id\n    \n    # Alias: #42 or 42\n    alias_str = issue_id.lstrip('#')\n    try:\n        alias = int(alias_str)\n        # Call bd to resolve\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['bd', 'alias', 'find', f'bd-{alias}'],\n            capture_output=True, text=True\n        )\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            return result.stdout.strip()\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Invalid format\n    raise ValueError(f\"Invalid issue ID: {issue_id}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Update Response Formatting\nShow aliases in responses:\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_show(issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    resolved_id = resolve_issue_id(issue_id)\n    \n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'show', resolved_id], ...)\n    \n    # Parse response and add alias info\n    # Format: \"bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #42)\"\n    ...\n```\n\n### 4. Add beads_alias_* Functions\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_list() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"List all alias mappings.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'list'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_set(alias: int, issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Manually assign alias to issue.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'set', str(alias), issue_id], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_compact() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Compact aliases to fill gaps.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'compact'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n```\n\n### 5. Update Documentation\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs (v2.0+)\n\nThe MCP server accepts both hash IDs and aliases:\n\n```python\n# Using hash IDs\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n\n# Using aliases\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"42\")  # Shorthand\n```\n\n## Alias Management\n\nNew functions for alias control:\n\n- `beads_alias_list()` - List all alias mappings\n- `beads_alias_set(alias, issue_id)` - Manually assign alias\n- `beads_alias_compact()` - Compact aliases to fill gaps\n\n## Migration\n\nAfter migrating to hash IDs:\n1. Update beads-mcp: `pip install --upgrade beads-mcp`\n2. Restart MCP server\n3. All existing workflows continue to work\n```\n\n### 6. Version Compatibility\nDetect and handle both v1.x and v2.0 formats:\n\n```python\ndef detect_beads_version() -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Detect if beads is using sequential or hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'list', '-n', '1'], ...)\n    first_id = parse_first_issue_id(result.stdout)\n    \n    if first_id.startswith('bd-') and len(first_id) \u003e 11:\n        return '2.0'  # Hash ID\n    else:\n        return '1.x'  # Sequential ID\n\n# On startup\nbeads_version = detect_beads_version()\nlogger.info(f\"Detected beads version: {beads_version}\")\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py\n\n```python\ndef test_resolve_hash_id():\n    \"\"\"Hash IDs pass through unchanged.\"\"\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"bd-af78e9a2\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_resolve_alias():\n    \"\"\"Aliases resolve to hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    # Mock bd alias find command\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"#42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_invalid_id():\n    \"\"\"Invalid IDs raise ValueError.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        resolve_issue_id(\"invalid\")\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n```python\nasync def test_show_with_hash_id(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text\n\nasync def test_show_with_alias(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text  # Resolved\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\nThe MCP server should work with both:\n- Beads v1.x (sequential IDs)\n- Beads v2.0+ (hash IDs)\n\nDetection happens at runtime based on issue ID format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n- integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py (new)\n- integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml (bump version)\n\n## Deployment\n```bash\ncd integrations/beads-mcp\n# Bump version to 2.0.0\npoetry version 2.0.0\n# Publish to PyPI\npoetry publish --build\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.256074-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.257315-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.258057-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}
