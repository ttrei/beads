Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1. Second daemon start fails with \"daemon already running\" error\n✅ 2. Killing daemon releases lock, new daemon can start  \n✅ 3.

Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6. Add `bd validate` command to detect divergence\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.959435-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.207148-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T21:57:03.06641-07:00"}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.19679-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T22:22:20.406934-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

When 5+ clones create issues with same ID, Git merge conflicts require manual resolution, and our collision resolver can fail during convergence rounds.\n\n## Research Question\nCould jujutsu (jj) provide better conflict handling for JSONL files?\n\n## Jujutsu Overview\n- Next-gen VCS built on libgit2\n- Designed to handle conflicts as first-class citizens\n- Supports conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) in some scenarios\n- Better handling of concurrent edits\n- Can work with Git repos (compatible with existing infrastructure)\n\n## Investigation Tasks\n1. JSONL Merge Behavior - How does jj handle line-by-line JSONL conflicts?\n2. Integration Feasibility - Can beads use jj as backend while maintaining Git compatibility?\n3. Conflict Resolution Model - Does jj conflict model map to our collision resolution?\n4. Operational Transform Support - Does jj implement operational transforms?\n\n## Deliverables\n1. Technical report on jj merge algorithm for JSONL\n2. Proof-of-concept: 5-clone collision test using jj instead of Git\n3. Performance comparison: Git vs jj for beads workload\n4.

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267736-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00"}

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:42:29.849243-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.190232-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T22:06:04.398141-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:52.260524-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.18193-07:00"}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3.

Refactor ImportIssues to be content-first\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\n```go\nfunc ImportIssues(ctx context.Context, dbPath string, store storage.Storage, \n    issues []*types.Issue, opts Options) (*Result, error) {\n    \n    result := \u0026Result{...}\n    \n    sqliteStore, needCloseStore, err := getOrCreateStore(ctx, dbPath, store)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    if needCloseStore {\n        defer func() { _ = sqliteStore.Close() }()\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 1: Compute content hashes for all incoming issues\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        issue.ContentHash = issue.ComputeContentHash()\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Build content hash maps\n    incomingByHash := buildHashMap(issues)\n    dbIssues, _ := sqliteStore.SearchIssues(ctx, \"\", types.IssueFilter{})\n    dbByHash := buildHashMap(dbIssues)\n    dbByID := buildIDMap(dbIssues)\n    \n    // Phase 3: Content-first matching\n    var newIssues []*types.Issue\n    var idConflicts []*CollisionDetail\n    \n    for hash, incoming := range incomingByHash {\n        if existing, found := dbByHash[hash]; found {\n            // Same content exists\n            if existing.ID == incoming.ID {\n                // Exact match - idempotent case\n                result.Unchanged++\n            } else {\n                // Same content, different ID - rename detected\n                // Delete old ID, keep new ID (incoming is canonical)\n                if err := handleRename(ctx, sqliteStore, existing, incoming); err != nil {\n                    return nil, err\n                }\n                result.Updated++\n            }\n        } else {\n            // New content - check for ID collision\n            if existingWithID, found := dbByID[incoming.ID]; found {\n                // ID exists but different content - collision\n                idConflicts = append(idConflicts, \u0026CollisionDetail{\n                    ID:            incoming.ID,\n                    IncomingIssue: incoming,\n                    ExistingIssue: existingWithID,\n                })\n            } else {\n                // Truly new issue\n                newIssues = append(newIssues, incoming)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 4: Resolve ID conflicts using global algorithm\n    if len(idConflicts) \u003e 0 {\n        if !opts.ResolveCollisions {\n            return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"collision detected\")\n        }\n        \n        idMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n            idConflicts, issues)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        \n        if err := applyIDMapping(ctx, sqliteStore, idMapping); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        \n        result.IDMapping = idMapping\n        result.Collisions = len(idConflicts)\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 5: Create new issues\n    if len(newIssues) \u003e 0 {\n        if err := sqliteStore.CreateIssues(ctx, newIssues, \"import\"); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        result.Created = len(newIssues)\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 6: Import dependencies, labels, comments (existing logic)\n    // ...\n    \n    return result, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// buildHashMap creates a map of content hash → issue\nfunc buildHashMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// buildIDMap creates a map of ID → issue\nfunc buildIDMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ID] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// handleRename handles content match with different IDs\nfunc handleRename(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage, \n    existing *types.Issue, incoming *types.Issue) error {\n    \n    // Delete old ID\n    if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, existing.ID); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete old ID %s: %w\", existing.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Create with new ID\n    if err := s.CreateIssue(ctx, incoming, \"import-rename\"); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create renamed issue %s: %w\", \n            incoming.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Update references from old ID to new ID\n    idMapping := map[string]string{existing.ID: incoming.ID}\n    return updateReferences(ctx, s, idMapping)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add idempotency tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. Import same JSONL twice → second import reports all Unchanged\n2. Import, modify DB, import again → reports Updated\n3. Import with rename, import again → idempotent\n4. Import with collision resolution, import again → idempotent\n\n### 4. Update handleCollisions to use new flow\nCurrent handleCollisions in importer.go needs to be updated to:\n- Use content-first matching\n- Call new ResolveNWayCollisions\n- Apply results using ApplyCollisionResolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Import matches by content hash before checking IDs\n- Importing same JSONL multiple times is idempotent (reports Unchanged)\n- Rename detection works (same content, different ID)\n- ID conflicts resolved using global algorithm\n- Result.Unchanged correctly tracks idempotent imports\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes\n- All existing import tests still pass\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- buildHashMap correctly indexes by content hash\n- buildIDMap correctly indexes by ID\n- handleRename deletes old, creates new, updates references\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Import same data twice → idempotent\n- Import renamed issue → handled correctly\n- Import with collision → resolved globally\n- Final pull after 3-way collision → all clones converge\n\n### Property Tests\n- Idempotency: Import(x); Import(x) ≡ Import(x)\n- Commutativity: Import(a); Import(b) ≡ Import(b); Import(a) (for non-colliding issues)\n- Convergence: After N rounds of sync, all clones identical\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/importer/importer.go (major refactor of ImportIssues)\n- internal/importer/importer_test.go (new tests)\n- cmd/bd/import_bug_test.go (update for new behavior)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.3 (global resolution)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nMajor refactor of import logic. Recommend:\n1. Comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Feature flag to enable/disable\n3. Keep old import code path for rollback\n4. Test with all existing import tests\n5. Manual testing with real repositories\n\n## Success Metrics\nAfter this phase:\n- TestThreeCloneCollision should PASS\n- All clones converge after final pull\n- Import is demonstrably idempotent\n- No data loss in N-way scenarios","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:38:25.671302-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.229134-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:21:39.529971-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.616846-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.360026-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.383624-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.407157-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Added `ExecInTransaction` helper to SQLiteStorage for atomic database operations\n2. Added `IsUniqueConstraintError` function to detect UNIQUE constraint violations\n3. Wrapped `RemapCollisions` with retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with counter sync between retries\n4. Enhanced `handleRename` to detect and handle race conditions where target ID already exists\n5. Added defensive checks for when old ID has been deleted by another clone\n\n## Test Results\n\nThe changes improve N-way collision handling but don't fully solve the problem:\n- Original error: `UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id` during first convergence round\n- With changes: Test proceeds further but encounters different collision scenarios\n- New error: `target ID already exists with different content` in later convergence rounds\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is more complex than initially thought. In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:36:49.288841-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-e6d71828","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.1","type":"related","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:44:44.14653-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3.

ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5.

Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5.

MCP Function Signatures (No Change)\nFunctions already use issue IDs as strings, so they work with hash IDs:\n\n```python\n# These already work!\nbeads_show(issue_id: str)           # Accepts bd-af78e9a2 or #42\nbeads_update(issue_id: str, ...)    # Accepts both formats\nbeads_close(issue_ids: List[str])   # Accepts both formats\n```\n\n### 2. Add Alias Resolution Helper\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n\n```python\ndef resolve_issue_id(issue_id: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Resolve alias to hash ID if needed.\"\"\"\n    # Hash ID: pass through\n    if issue_id.startswith('bd-') and len(issue_id) == 11:\n        return issue_id\n    \n    # Alias: #42 or 42\n    alias_str = issue_id.lstrip('#')\n    try:\n        alias = int(alias_str)\n        # Call bd to resolve\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['bd', 'alias', 'find', f'bd-{alias}'],\n            capture_output=True, text=True\n        )\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            return result.stdout.strip()\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Invalid format\n    raise ValueError(f\"Invalid issue ID: {issue_id}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Update Response Formatting\nShow aliases in responses:\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_show(issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    resolved_id = resolve_issue_id(issue_id)\n    \n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'show', resolved_id], ...)\n    \n    # Parse response and add alias info\n    # Format: \"bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #42)\"\n    ...\n```\n\n### 4. Add beads_alias_* Functions\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_list() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"List all alias mappings.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'list'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_set(alias: int, issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Manually assign alias to issue.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'set', str(alias), issue_id], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_compact() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Compact aliases to fill gaps.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'compact'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n```\n\n### 5. Update Documentation\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs (v2.0+)\n\nThe MCP server accepts both hash IDs and aliases:\n\n```python\n# Using hash IDs\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n\n# Using aliases\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"42\")  # Shorthand\n```\n\n## Alias Management\n\nNew functions for alias control:\n\n- `beads_alias_list()` - List all alias mappings\n- `beads_alias_set(alias, issue_id)` - Manually assign alias\n- `beads_alias_compact()` - Compact aliases to fill gaps\n\n## Migration\n\nAfter migrating to hash IDs:\n1. Update beads-mcp: `pip install --upgrade beads-mcp`\n2. Restart MCP server\n3. All existing workflows continue to work\n```\n\n### 6. Version Compatibility\nDetect and handle both v1.x and v2.0 formats:\n\n```python\ndef detect_beads_version() -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Detect if beads is using sequential or hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'list', '-n', '1'], ...)\n    first_id = parse_first_issue_id(result.stdout)\n    \n    if first_id.startswith('bd-') and len(first_id) \u003e 11:\n        return '2.0'  # Hash ID\n    else:\n        return '1.x'  # Sequential ID\n\n# On startup\nbeads_version = detect_beads_version()\nlogger.info(f\"Detected beads version: {beads_version}\")\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py\n\n```python\ndef test_resolve_hash_id():\n    \"\"\"Hash IDs pass through unchanged.\"\"\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"bd-af78e9a2\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_resolve_alias():\n    \"\"\"Aliases resolve to hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    # Mock bd alias find command\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"#42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_invalid_id():\n    \"\"\"Invalid IDs raise ValueError.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        resolve_issue_id(\"invalid\")\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n```python\nasync def test_show_with_hash_id(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text\n\nasync def test_show_with_alias(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text  # Resolved\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\nThe MCP server should work with both:\n- Beads v1.x (sequential IDs)\n- Beads v2.0+ (hash IDs)\n\nDetection happens at runtime based on issue ID format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n- integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py (new)\n- integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml (bump version)\n\n## Deployment\n```bash\ncd integrations/beads-mcp\n# Bump version to 2.0.0\npoetry version 2.0.0\n# Publish to PyPI\npoetry publish --build\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.256074-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.257315-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.258057-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}
