# Using bd in Claude Code for Web

This guide shows how to automatically install and use bd (beads issue tracker) in Claude Code for Web sessions using SessionStart hooks.

## What is Claude Code for Web?

Claude Code for Web provides full Linux VM sandboxes with npm support. Each session is a fresh environment, so tools need to be installed at the start of each session.

## Why npm Package Instead of Direct Binary?

Claude Code for Web environments:
- ✅ Have npm pre-installed and configured
- ✅ Can install global npm packages easily
- ❌ May have restrictions on direct binary downloads
- ❌ Don't persist installations between sessions

The `@beads/bd` npm package solves this by:
1. Installing via npm (which is always available)
2. Downloading the native binary during postinstall
3. Providing a CLI wrapper that "just works"

## Setup

### Option 1: SessionStart Hook (Recommended)

Create or edit `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` in your project:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/session-start.sh

# Install bd globally (only takes a few seconds)
echo "Installing bd (beads issue tracker)..."
npm install -g @beads/bd

# Initialize bd in the project (if not already initialized)
if [ ! -d .beads ]; then
  bd init --quiet
fi

echo "✓ bd is ready! Use 'bd ready' to see available work."
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation Each Session

If you prefer not to use hooks, you can manually install at the start of each session:

```bash
npm install -g @beads/bd
bd init --quiet
```

### Option 3: Project-Local Installation

Install as a dev dependency (slower but doesn't require global install):

```bash
npm install --save-dev @beads/bd

# Use with npx
npx bd version
npx bd ready
```

## Verification

After installation, verify bd is working:

```bash
# Check version
bd version

# Check database info
bd info

# See what work is ready
bd ready --json
```

## Usage in Claude Code for Web

Once installed, bd works identically to the native version:

```bash
# Create issues
bd create "Fix authentication bug" -t bug -p 1

# View ready work
bd ready

# Update status
bd update bd-a1b2 --status in_progress

# Add dependencies
bd dep add bd-f14c bd-a1b2

# Close issues
bd close bd-a1b2 --reason "Fixed"
```

## Agent Integration

Tell your agent to use bd by adding to your AGENTS.md or project instructions:

```markdown
## Issue Tracking

Use the `bd` command for all issue tracking instead of markdown TODOs:

- Create issues: `bd create "Task description" -p 1 --json`
- Find work: `bd ready --json`
- Update status: `bd update <id> --status in_progress --json`
- View details: `bd show <id> --json`

Use `--json` flags for programmatic parsing.
```

## How It Works

1. **SessionStart Hook**: Runs automatically when session starts
2. **npm install**: Downloads the @beads/bd package from npm registry
3. **postinstall**: Package automatically downloads the native binary for your platform
4. **CLI Wrapper**: `bd` command is a Node.js wrapper that invokes the native binary
5. **bd init**: Sets up the .beads directory and imports existing issues from git

## Performance

- **First install**: ~5-10 seconds (one-time per session)
- **Binary download**: ~3-5 seconds (darwin-arm64 binary is ~17MB)
- **Subsequent commands**: Native speed (<100ms)

## Troubleshooting

### "bd: command not found"

The SessionStart hook didn't run or installation failed. Manually run:

```bash
npm install -g @beads/bd
```

### "Error installing bd: HTTP 404"

The version in package.json doesn't match a GitHub release. This shouldn't happen with published npm packages, but if it does, check:

```bash
npm view @beads/bd versions
```

And install a specific version:

```bash
npm install -g @beads/bd@0.21.5
```

### "Binary not found after extraction"

Platform detection may have failed. Check:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('os').platform(), require('os').arch())"
```

Should output something like: `linux x64`

### Slow installation

The binary download may be slow depending on network conditions. The native binary is ~17MB, which should download in a few seconds on most connections.

If it's consistently slow, consider:
1. Using a different npm registry mirror
2. Caching the installation (if Claude Code for Web supports it)

## Benefits Over WASM

This npm package wraps the **native** bd binary rather than using WebAssembly because:

- ✅ **Full SQLite support**: No custom VFS or compatibility issues
- ✅ **All features work**: 100% feature parity with standalone bd
- ✅ **Better performance**: Native speed vs WASM overhead
- ✅ **Simpler maintenance**: Single binary build, no WASM-specific code
- ✅ **Faster installation**: One binary download vs WASM compilation

## Examples

### Example SessionStart Hook with Error Handling

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/session-start.sh

set -e  # Exit on error

echo "🔗 Setting up bd (beads issue tracker)..."

# Install bd globally
if ! command -v bd &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Installing @beads/bd from npm..."
    npm install -g @beads/bd --quiet
else
    echo "bd already installed"
fi

# Verify installation
if bd version &> /dev/null; then
    echo "✓ bd $(bd version)"
else
    echo "✗ bd installation failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Initialize if needed
if [ ! -d .beads ]; then
    echo "Initializing bd in project..."
    bd init --quiet
else
    echo "bd already initialized"
fi

# Show ready work
echo ""
echo "Ready work:"
bd ready --limit 5

echo ""
echo "✓ bd is ready! Use 'bd --help' for commands."
```

### Example Claude Code Prompt

```
You are working on a project that uses bd (beads) for issue tracking.

At the start of each session:
1. Run `bd ready --json` to see available work
2. Choose an issue to work on
3. Update its status: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`

While working:
- Create new issues for any bugs you discover
- Link related issues with `bd dep add`
- Add comments with `bd comments add <id> "comment text"`

When done:
- Close the issue: `bd close <id> --reason "Description of what was done"`
- Commit your changes including .beads/issues.jsonl
```

## Alternative: Package as Project Dependency

If you prefer to track bd as a project dependency instead of global install:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@beads/bd": "^0.21.5"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "bd": "bd",
    "ready": "bd ready",
    "postinstall": "bd init --quiet || true"
  }
}
```

Then use with npm scripts or npx:

```bash
npm run ready
npx bd create "New issue"
```
